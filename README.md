📚 Student Management Application and Visualization Dashboard 📊

Welcome to my Student Management Application project! 🎓📈 In this project, I've created a comprehensive platform to efficiently manage student data and marks while providing an insightful visualization dashboard using Python's powerful libraries.

📋 **Project Overview:**
I've designed and developed a user-friendly Student Management Application that securely stores personal student information and their marks across various subjects. Leveraging the power of Pandas and Numpy libraries, I've ensured seamless data management and efficient calculations.

📊 **Visualization Dashboard:**
The highlight of this project is the dynamic visualization dashboard powered by Matplotlib. It offers engaging bar graphs that allow users to compare student marks across different subjects at a glance, aiding educators and students in assessing performance trends.

🌐 **Customized User Experience:**
Taking it a step further, I've personalized the dashboard by integrating real-time information. Through web scraping using Beautiful Soup, I've pulled data like location and weather from web pages, providing users with valuable context alongside academic insights.

🚀 **Key Features:**
- Efficient student data storage and management.
- Calculation of marks and statistical insights.
- Intuitive visualization dashboard with bar graphs.
- Real-time location and weather integration for context.
